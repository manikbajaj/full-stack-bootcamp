<!-- Practice: HTML Structure One -->
<!-- 
!Objective:
TODO: Create a single HTML page that incorporates the following concepts: block and inline elements, HTML entities and symbols, and various types of lists. This exercise will test your ability to apply these concepts effectively in a practical scenario.

!Instructions:
* 1. Block vs. Inline Elements
?- Create a section that demonstrates the difference between block and inline elements.
?- Include at least one block-level element and one inline element within the block element.
?- Add another block-level element outside the first to observe how the layout changes.

* 2. HTML Entities and Symbols
?- Use HTML entities to display at least two reserved characters (e.g., less-than, greater-than).
?- Include symbols like the copyright or registered trademark using both entities and direct symbols.

* 3. Unordered Lists
?- Create an unordered list with at least three items.
?- Ensure that the items listed do not require a specific order.

* 4. Ordered Lists
?- Create an ordered list with at least four steps for a process or sequence.
?- Choose a task where the order of items is crucial.

* 5. Description Lists
?- Create a description list where you define at least three terms with their corresponding descriptions.
?- Ensure that the terms and definitions are clearly related and easy to understand.
