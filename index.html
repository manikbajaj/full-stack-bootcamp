<!-- 
    !Instructions:
    * You are provided with the HTML structure. Your task is to write the CSS in a separate file named style.css to achieve the goals for each section.
    
    * Focus on the specific properties mentioned for each task and ensure the layout and behavior follow the instructions.
    
    * Test your code by applying various styles to check if the elements behave as expected

    TODO 1: The box-sizing Property
    * Ensure that padding and borders are included in the element's width and height using the box-sizing property.
    * The total width of the element, including padding and borders, should not exceed 300px.
    
    TODO 2: The Overflow Property
    * Apply the appropriate overflow property to handle overflowing content.
    * The content should be scrollable if it overflows the available space.
    
    TODO 3: Max and Min Properties
    * Constrain the element’s width and height using max-width, min-width, max-height, and min-height properties.
    * Ensure the element doesn’t shrink below or expand beyond the specified limits.
    
    TODO 4: Working with Floats
    * Make two boxes float side by side using the float property (float: left and float: right).
    * Ensure they are correctly aligned within their container.
    
    TODO 5: Positioning in CSS
    * Use relative, absolute, and fixed positioning for different elements:
    * The relative element should move 20px from the top-left of its original position.
    * The absolute element should be placed inside its parent.
    * The fixed element should be fixed at the bottom-right of the viewport.
    
    TODO 6: Layers and Z-Index
    * Use z-index to layer the elements in the correct order:
    * Assign higher z-index values to elements you want to appear on top of others.
