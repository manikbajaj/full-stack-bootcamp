      The <a> tag is called the anchor tag because it "anchors" a hyperlink to a specific part of a web page or another page entirely.

    A relative URL provides the path relative to the current page's location. It omits the protocol and domain name, referencing only the path within the website. Example: folder/page.html.

    <!-- Pages inside nested directories can be linked as well -->
    <!-- new page /blogs/index.html -->
    <a href="/blogs/index.html">Blog Page</a><br />

    <!-- 
    Even if I use blogs in most of the cases the default file thata  server will look for is index.html, so something like this works in most sitautions
    But its better to use the correct file
    -->
    <a href="/blogs">Blog Page Without index</a><br />

    <!-- Absolute Url's can be used as well -->
    <!-- 
    An absolute URL contains the complete web address, including the protocol (e.g., https://), domain name, and path. Example:
    -->
    <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a><br />

    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/">Google New Tab</a><br />
    <!-- _self is the defualt browser behaviour -->
