      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a
      web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within
      a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data
      tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic
      understanding of HTML and its functions.
