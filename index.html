    <h1>Combinator Selectors in CSS</h1>

    <!-- Descendant Selector Example -->
    <div>
      <h2>Descendant Selector (space)</h2>
      <!-- This will be blue because it's a <p> inside a <div> -->
      <p>This paragraph is a descendant of the div.</p>
      <!-- Nested <div> with <p>, still a descendant -->
      <div>
        <p>This nested paragraph is also a descendant of the outer div.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Child Selector Example -->
    <div>
      <h2>Child Selector (>)</h2>
      <!-- This will be bold because it's a direct child of the <div> -->
      <p>This paragraph is a direct child of the div and will be bold.</p>
      <!-- This won't be affected because it's nested, not a direct child -->
      <div>
        <p>This nested paragraph is not a direct child.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Adjacent Sibling Selector Example -->
    <h2>Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)</h2>
    <!-- This will be green because it's the immediate sibling of the <h2> -->
    <p>This paragraph is an adjacent sibling of the previous h2.</p>
    <!-- This won't be affected because it's not immediately after the <h2> -->
    <p>This paragraph is not an adjacent sibling of the previous h2.</p>

    <!-- General Sibling Selector Example -->
    <h2>General Sibling Selector (~)</h2>
    <!-- All these <p> elements after <h2> will have a lightgray background -->
    <p>This paragraph is a general sibling of the h2.</p>
    <p>This paragraph is also a general sibling of the h2.</p>
