      HTML Entities:
      Definition: HTML entities are special codes that represent characters in HTML that might otherwise be interpreted as code. They begin with & and end with ;.
      Example: &lt; represents <, &amp; represents &.
      
      HTML Symbols:
      Definition: HTML symbols refer to special characters or icons that are part of the Unicode standard. They can be used directly in HTML or represented by entities.
      Example: © (copyright symbol), € (euro symbol).

    <!-- Non breaking space character -->
    <p>A space character: &nbsp;here</p>
    <p>A space character: &#160;here</p>

    <!-- Less than entity -->
    <p>10 &lt; 20</p>
    <p>10 &#60; 20</p>

    <!-- Euro symbol -->
    <p>I will display &euro;</p>
    <p>I will display &#8364;</p>

    <!-- Copyright symbol -->
    <p>I will display &copy;</p>
    <p>I will display &#169;</p>

    <!-- Registered symbol -->
    <p>I will display &reg;</p>
    <p>I will display &#174;</p>

    <!-- 
    WHY USE ENTITIES AND SYMBOLS
    Reserved Characters: Some characters like <, >, and & are reserved in HTML for tags and special syntax. Using entities (&lt;, &gt;, &amp;) prevents these characters from being misinterpreted as HTML code.

    Consistency Across Platforms: Entities ensure that characters display correctly across different browsers, devices, and fonts, especially for special symbols not present on all keyboards.
