  !Practice Pseudo-Classes, Pseudo-Elements, and CSS Attribute Selectors
  * In this exercise, you will be provided with an HTML structure. Your task is to write the CSS to style the specified elements using Pseudo-Classes, Pseudo-Elements, and Attribute Selectors. The focus is on selecting the correct elements and applying the requested styles.

    !Instructions: CSS Tasks
    * Use the provided HTML and write CSS to style the elements based on the following requirements. Focus on using Pseudo-Classes, Pseudo-Elements, and Attribute Selectors.

    !Part 1: Pseudo-Classes
    * Style the first navigation link in the <nav> using the :first-child pseudo-class to have a background color of lightblue.
    * Style the last item in the <ul> list using the :last-child pseudo-class to have a font color of green.
    * Apply a hover effect to all navigation links (<a>) to change their text color to red when hovered.
    * Style the active navigation link (<a> with class "active") to have a bold font.

    ! Part 2: Pseudo-Elements
    * Use the ::before pseudo-element to insert the word "Note: " before the paragraph with the class .intro-text.
    * Style the first letter of the second paragraph in the content section (the one without the class) using ::first-letter to have a font size of 2em and color blue.
    * In the <footer>, style the first line of the text using the ::first-line pseudo-element to have a bold font.

    ! Part 3: Attribute Selectors
    * Use the [lang] attribute selector to target the <article> with lang="en-US" and apply a background color of #f0f0f0.
    * Style all navigation links (<a>) that have an href attribute ending with .html using [href$=".html"] to have an underline.
