    <h1>CSS Position Property Demonstration</h1>

    <!-- Static Position Example -->
    <!-- 
    Static Position (Default):
      position: static is the default position for all elements. Elements appear in the normal document flow, meaning they are displayed one after another in the order they are written in the HTML.
      Elements with position: static are not affected by positioning properties like top, left, right, or bottom.
      In this example, the red box follows the regular document flow and does not respond to any position-related adjustments.
     -->
    <section>
      <h2>Static Position (Default)</h2>
      <div class="box static-box">Static Position</div>
      <p>
        Explanation: The default position of all HTML elements is
        <strong>static</strong>. In this mode, elements follow the normal
        document flow, meaning they appear one after another in the order they
        are written in the HTML. They do not respond to positioning properties
        like <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, or
        <code>bottom</code>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Relative Position Example -->
    <!-- 
      position: relative allows an element to be positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. The element is shifted using the top, left, right, or bottom properties, but its original position is still reserved in the layout.
      Other elements will behave as though the relatively positioned element is still in its original spot, even if it is moved.
      In this example, the green box is positioned 20px down and 20px to the right of its original position but still takes up space where it was initially placed.
     -->
    <section>
      <h2>Relative Position</h2>
      <div class="box relative-box">Relative Position</div>
      <p>
        Explanation: With <strong>position: relative</strong>, the element is
        positioned relative to its original position in the normal document
        flow. The <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> properties adjust the
        element's position without removing it from the flow, meaning other
        elements still consider it in its original location.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Absolute Position Example -->
    <!-- 
      position: absolute removes the element from the normal document flow. The element is then positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (an element with position: relative, absolute, or fixed).
      If no positioned ancestor is found, the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the <html> element or the browser window).
      In this example, the orange box is positioned 100px from the top and left of its parent container, which has position: relative.
     -->
    <section class="container">
      <h2>Absolute Position</h2>
      <div class="box absolute-box">Absolute Position</div>
      <p>
        Explanation: With <strong>position: absolute</strong>, the element is
        removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to its
        closest positioned ancestor (an element with
        <code>position: relative</code>, <code>absolute</code>, or
        <code>fixed</code>). Here, it's positioned 100px from the top and left
        of the container.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Fixed Position Example -->
    <!-- 
    position: fixed also removes the element from the normal document flow, but the element is positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window). It stays fixed in place even when the page is scrolled.
    In this example, the dark blue box stays fixed 20px from the top and right of the viewport, regardless of page scrolling.
    -->
    <section>
      <h2>Fixed Position</h2>
      <div class="box fixed-box">Fixed Position</div>
      <p>
        Explanation: With <strong>position: fixed</strong>, the element is
        removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to the
        viewport. It remains fixed in place as the page scrolls. In this case,
        the element stays fixed at 20px from the top and right of the viewport.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Sticky Position Example -->
    <!-- 
    position: sticky is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning.
    When the element is within its container, it behaves like position: relative and scrolls with the page.
    Once it reaches the specified position (in this case, 10px from the top), it "sticks" and behaves like position: fixed, staying in place while the rest of the content scrolls past it.
    -->
    <section style="height: 1000px; background-color: antiquewhite">
      <h2>Sticky Position</h2>
      <div class="box sticky-box">Sticky Position</div>
      <p>
        Explanation: With <strong>position: sticky</strong>, the element acts
        like <code>relative</code> until it reaches a specified scroll position,
        after which it "sticks" and behaves like <code>fixed</code>. In this
        case, the element will stick 10px from the top of the viewport as you
        scroll down.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Extra space to allow for scrolling -->
    <div class="extra-space"></div>
  </body>
</html>
