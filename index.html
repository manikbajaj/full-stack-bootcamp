<!-- 
  !Instructions for Students:
  You are given an HTML file. Your task is to write the CSS in a separate file named style.css to style the elements.

  TODO 1: Demonstrate Source Order of Styles
  * Apply two different colors to the .source-order class. One should come before the other in the stylesheet. The color that is applied later should be the one that is displayed.

  TODO 2: Demonstrate Specificity in CSS
  * Use element, class, and ID selectors to demonstrate how specificity works. Write CSS that styles the <p> with the class .specificity and ID #specificity-example.
  * The ID selector should win over the class and element selectors.
  
  TODO 3: Using the !important Flag
  * Style the .important-flag class with two colors. Use !important on one of the rules so it overrides any other rule, even if it comes first or has lower specificity.

  TODO 4: Combined Cascade Algorithm
  * In this task, demonstrate source order, specificity, and !important together.
  * Write rules that target the .cascade-example class and #cascade-example ID. Apply conflicting styles and use the cascade algorithm to resolve the conflict (including !important).
