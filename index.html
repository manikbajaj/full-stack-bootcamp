    <title>JavaScript: Null and Undefined</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      // 1. Undefined
      // Declaring a variable without initializing it gives the value 'undefined'.
      let unassignedVariable;
      console.log("Unassigned variable:", unassignedVariable); // Output: undefined

      // 2. Null
      // Null is explicitly assigned to a variable to indicate "no value".
      let emptyVariable = null;
      console.log("Empty variable:", emptyVariable); // Output: null

      // 3. Key Difference: Null vs Undefined
      console.log("Type of undefined:", typeof unassignedVariable); // Output: 'undefined'
      /**
       * In JavaScript, the output of typeof null returns 'object' due to a historical quirk in the language. When JavaScript was first created, values were stored as binary data, and the type tag for objects was 0. However, null was also given the same type tag, meaning it was accidentally classified as an object. Although this is recognized as an error, it has been left unchanged to maintain backward compatibility with older code.
       */
      console.log("Type of null:", typeof emptyVariable); // Output: 'object' (this is a quirk in JavaScript)

      // 4. Reassigning Undefined
      // Undefined is automatically assigned when a variable is declared but not initialized.
      let example;
      console.log("Initially:", example); // Output: undefined

      example = 5; // Now assigning a value
      console.log("After assigning a value:", example); // Output: 5

      // 5. Reassigning Null
      // Null must be explicitly assigned to a variable. It means "nothing" or "empty".
      let person = null; // No person initially
      console.log("Person initially:", person); // Output: null

      person = "John"; // Later assigning a value
      console.log("Person after assignment:", person); // Output: John
