    <h1>CSS Z-Index Demonstration</h1>

    <!-- Z-Index Basics Example -->
    <!-- 
    z-index controls the stacking order of positioned elements (those with position: relative, absolute, or fixed).
    Elements with a higher z-index value are stacked on top of elements with a lower z-index.
    In this example, three boxes are positioned with different z-index values. The green box (z-index: 3) is stacked on top, followed by the red box (z-index: 2), and the blue box (z-index: 1).
     -->
    <section class="container">
      <h2>Z-Index: Controlling Stacking Order</h2>
      <div class="box box1">z-index: 1</div>
      <div class="box box2">z-index: 2</div>
      <div class="box box3">z-index: 3</div>
      <p>
        Explanation: The <strong>z-index</strong> property controls the stacking
        order of positioned elements. Elements with a higher z-index value are
        stacked on top of those with a lower z-index. Here, the green box
        (z-index: 3) is on top, followed by the red box (z-index: 2), and the
        blue box (z-index: 1) at the bottom.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Example without z-index -->
    <!-- 
    When no z-index is specified, the stacking order is determined by the order of the elements in the DOM (Document Object Model). Later elements in the HTML are stacked on top of earlier ones.
This section demonstrates how elements without a z-index behave when placed in the same container. The second box appears on top of the first simply because it comes later in the code.
     -->
    <section class="container">
      <h2>Elements Without Z-Index</h2>
      <div class="box-no-zindex">No z-index</div>
      <div class="box-overlapping">No z-index</div>
      <p>
        Explanation: When no <strong>z-index</strong> is specified, elements are
        stacked based on their order in the DOM. Here, the second box appears on
        top simply because it comes later in the code.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Example showing stacking context and how it resets with nested elements -->

    <!-- 
    When a parent element has a z-index value, it creates a new stacking context. The child elements' z-index values are calculated relative to their parent, not the entire page.
    In this example, the parent has a z-index: 10, and the child has a z-index: 5. Even though the child has a lower z-index than the parent, it is still nested within the parent and does not overlap it.
    -->
    <section class="container">
      <h2>Stacking Context: Nested Elements</h2>
      <div
        style="
          position: relative;
          z-index: 10;
          background-color: lightgreen;
          padding: 20px;
        "
      >
        Parent Element (z-index: 10)
        <div
          style="
            position: absolute;
            z-index: 5;
            background-color: lightcoral;
            width: 100px;
            height: 100px;
            top: 50px;
            left: 50px;
          "
        >
          Child Element (z-index: 5)
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Explanation: A new <strong>stacking context</strong> is created when a
        positioned element has a z-index. The child element’s z-index (5) is
        relative to the parent’s stacking context (z-index: 10), meaning the
        parent remains on top even though its z-index is higher.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Example with z-index and negative z-index -->

    <!-- 
    Negative z-index values allow elements to be stacked behind other elements with a positive or zero z-index.
    In this example, the blue box has a z-index: -1, so it appears behind the red box, which has a z-index: 1.
    -->
    <!-- 
      The parent container now has z-index: 0 to ensure that the element with z-index: -1 appears behind other elements inside the container but still within the visible stacking context of the parent.
      This avoids the blue box being hidden behind the gray container itself.
      THIS IS STACKING CONTEXT
      -->
    <section class="container" style="position: relative; z-index: 0">
      <h2>Z-Index With Negative Values</h2>
      <div
        class="box"
        style="
          background-color: lightblue;
          position: absolute;
          top: 150px;
          left: 150px;
          z-index: -1;
        "
      >
        z-index: -1
      </div>
      <div
        class="box"
        style="
          background-color: lightcoral;
          position: absolute;
          top: 100px;
          left: 100px;
          z-index: 1;
        "
      >
        z-index: 1
      </div>
      <p>
        Explanation: <strong>z-index</strong> can also be set to negative
        values, which places elements behind those with a positive z-index or no
        z-index. In this case, the blue box (z-index: -1) appears behind the red
        box (z-index: 1).
