    <h1>CSS Cascade: Source Order, Specificity, and !important</h1>

    <!-- Step 1: !important Wins Over Everything -->
    <section>
      <h2>Step 1: !important Wins</h2>
      <p class="important-example">This text is controlled by !important.</p>
      <!-- Explanation: Even though multiple rules are applied to this element, the !important flag makes this text red. -->
    </section>

    <!-- Step 2: Specificity Determines the Winner -->
    <section>
      <h2>Step 2: Specificity Comparison</h2>
      <p class="specificity-example" id="id-example">
        This text is controlled by a more specific selector.
      </p>
      <!-- Explanation: The ID selector will win because it is more specific than a class selector. -->
    </section>

    <!-- Step 3: Source Order Wins When Specificity Is Equal -->
    <section>
      <h2>Step 3: Source Order Comparison</h2>
      <p class="order-example">This text is controlled by source order.</p>
      <!-- Explanation: Both selectors are of equal specificity, so the rule declared later in the CSS will win. -->
    </section>

    <!-- Combined Example: Source Order, Specificity, and !important -->
    <section>
      <h2>Combined Example</h2>
      <p class="combined-example" id="combined-id">
        This text will follow all three steps to determine its final style.
      </p>
      <!-- Explanation: This element will resolve conflicts using the !important flag, specificity, and source order in that order. -->
